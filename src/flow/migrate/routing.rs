//! Functions for adding ingress/egress nodes.
//!
//! In particular:
//!
//!  - New nodes that are children of nodes in a different domain must be preceeded by an ingress
//!  - Egress nodes must be added to nodes that now have children in a different domain
//!  - Egress nodes that gain new children must gain channels to facilitate forwarding
//!  - Timestamp ingress nodes for existing domains must be connected to new base nodes
//!  - Timestamp ingress nodes must be added to all new domains
