//! Functions for identifying which nodes should be materialized, and what indices should be used
//! for those materializations.
//!
//! This module also holds the logic for *identifying* state that must be transfered from other
//! domains, but does not perform that copying itself (that is the role of the `augmentation`
//! module).
