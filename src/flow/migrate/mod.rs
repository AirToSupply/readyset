//! Logic for incorporating changes to a Soup graph into an already running graph.
//!
//! Performing a migration involves a number of steps:
//!
//!  - New nodes that are children of nodes in a different domain must be preceeded by an ingress
//!  - Egress nodes must be added to nodes that now have children in a different domain
//!  - Timestamp ingress nodes for existing domains must be connected to new base nodes
//!  - Timestamp ingress nodes must be added to all new domains
//!  - New nodes for existing domains must be sent to those domains
//!  - New domains must be booted up
//!  - Input channels must be set up for new base nodes
//!  - The graph must be analyzed for new materializations. These materializations must be
//!    *initialized* before data starts to flow to the new nodes. This may require two domains to
//!    communicate directly, and may delay migration completion.
//!  - Index requirements must be resolved, and checked for conflicts.
//!
//! Furthermore, these must be performed in the correct *order* so as to prevent dead- or
//! livelocks. This module defines methods for performing each step in relative isolation, as well
//! as a function for performing them in the right order.
//!
//! Beware, Here be dragonsâ„¢
